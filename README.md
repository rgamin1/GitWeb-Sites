# RiriWeb-Sites
This GitHub repo is based off of MtCrayFish's GitWeb. By no means am I taking any ownership of the work made by this amazing man.
I am only using this because I though that it would be cool to make a different version of GitWeb that is completely non moterated.
All credit goes to MrCrayFish.
